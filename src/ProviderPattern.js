// ðŸ¦Š Hi there! Here's the provider pattern!
// This helps you overcome the prop drilling problem that the render prop
// and component injection patterns both have. It allows developers to
// get access to your component's state at any spot within the render tree
// of your component. It leverages React.createContext heavily and in this
// example it's a fairly straightforward abstraction on top of that API.
//
// ðŸ¦‰ One thing you need to consider with this pattern is ensuring you're
// not re-rendering all consumers unecessarily. This is addressed and noted
// in our implementation above.
// Also, in our implementation, we're not exposing the ToggleContext directly
// and that's intentional. It allows us to implement the provider ourselves
// and expose a slightly more capable consumer. See the implementation notes
// for more on this.

  return (
    <Toggle {...props}>
      <div>
        {/*
           You can put whatever you want within the Toggle, and at any layer of
           the tree use Toggle.Consumer to access the Toggle state and helpers
        */}
