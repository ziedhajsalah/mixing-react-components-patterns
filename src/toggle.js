  // without concerning themselves how to wire up what they render to the Toggle

  // (in order to support the provider pattern and compound components), we need to
  // put everything into state that consumers will need, even event handlers.
  // A common (already!?) mistake people make with Context Providers is creating a
  // new object in the render method. Doing this will force the re-render of all
  // consumers even if no changes were actually made to the state we're exposing.
  // In this simple example the Toggle's render method wont run unless state was
  // changed in a way that would necessitate a re-render of consumers anyway, so
  // quite honestly it doesn't make a difference in this simple scenario, but it's
  // better to err on the side of caution than unecessary re-renders in this case.

  // 🦉 note that if you didn't want to expose _all_ your `state`, then you could
  // place things on a state property called `context`, but then any time you update
  // that state you'd have to do some extra work... Give it a try and you'll learn
  // why it's just easier to put things directly on `state` if you can.
